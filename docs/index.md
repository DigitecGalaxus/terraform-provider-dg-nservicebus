# dg-servicebus Provider

This provider allows you to manage [Endpoints](https://docs.particular.net/nservicebus/endpoints/) for [NServiceBus](https://docs.particular.net/nservicebus/) on Azure.

### Authentication

To authenticate, either provide credentials for a Service Principle on Azure or authenticate locally with the [Azure CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).
The Service Principal Credentials have higher priority over the Azure CLI and will be used first when provided.

To authenticate with the Azure CLI, do an `az login` in the shell before exectuing Terraform.

## Example Usage

```
terraform {
  required_providers {
    dgservicebus = {
      source = "DigitecGalaxus/dg-servicebus"
      version = ">= 1.0.0, < 2.0.0"
    }
  }

provider "dgservicebus" {
  azure_servicebus_hostname = "nservicebus.servicebus.windows.net"
  tenant_id                 = var.tenant_id
  client_id                 = var.client_id
  client_secret             = var.client_secret
}
```
