# dg-servicebus Provider

This provider allows you to manage [Endpoints](https://docs.particular.net/nservicebus/endpoints/) for [NServiceBus](https://docs.particular.net/nservicebus/) on Azure Service Bus.

### Authentication

To authenticate, either provide credentials for an Azure Service Principle or authenticate using [default credentials](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/python/api/azure-identity/azure.identity.defaultazurecredential?view=azure-python).
The Service Principal credentials take priority over the default credentials and will always be used, if provided.

To run the provider locally, install the [Azure CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli), which acts as a token source for the default credential. Be sure to run `az login` first, to log in with your account.

## Example Usage

```
terraform {
  required_providers {
    dgservicebus = {
      source = "DigitecGalaxus/dg-servicebus"
      version = ">= 1.0.0, < 2.0.0"
    }
  }

provider "dgservicebus" {
  azure_servicebus_hostname = "nservicebus.servicebus.windows.net"
  tenant_id                 = var.tenant_id
  client_id                 = var.client_id
  client_secret             = var.client_secret
}
